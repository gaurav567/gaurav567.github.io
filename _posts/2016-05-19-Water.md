title: Exploration into Water Usage and Affordability in the US
published: true
---

Water access, affordability, and quality have re-emerged as serious issues in the US and continue to be major problems in developing countries. I wanted to visualize the extent of this issue in the US using water price data and demographic information using clustering algorithms. Check out my repo on [github](https://github.com/pgr-me/metis_projects/tree/master/fletcher) for the code. 

## Methodology

I used univariate clustering on water usage, price, and income to identify municipalities and regions where water may be less affordable. Then, I performed a multivariate clustiner analysis to see how other factors, including demographic variables, may correlate with income and water usage and price. I obtained my demographic and geospatial data from the 2014 [US Census American Consumer Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) and price data from [Food and Water Watch](http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/insight/priceless-market-myth-water-pricing-reform).

## Analysis

A histogram of loans per year indicates that loans per year may be distributed exponentially, with most lenders making just a few loans  in a typical year. Within the sample, the mean loans per year was about 4 per year with a standard deviation of 12.

The chart below shows that Kiva users tend to be based in the US and male. Additionaly, almost 20% of the sample is involved in the tech industry or sciences.

I wanted to get an idea of the sample distribution by category, and so I created the chart below using [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/). We can see that the distribution of people from the US and Canada seems to be more concentrated at the lower end of loans per year axis than those in the rest of the world. In addition, high loans per year outliers are primarily male.

The statistical results are shown below. The R-squared value is low, and so the model's predictive power is nil. However, p values for the gender, region, invites per year, and lending reason features are low enough that we can reject the null hypothesis that these features have no impact on lending activity.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

This is a preliminary analysis, and more insights could be gleaned from the Kiva data. Even so, we can draw the following conclusions from this analysis:

- Microlending activity across microlenders seems to be exponentially distributed;
- While the model developed for this analysis is not predictive, it does explain a subset of the types of people that tends to make more microloans;
- Within the sample data, males and people living outside the US and Canada tend to be more active microlenders; and,
- More analysis is needed before we can say the same for people involved in tech and the sciences.

Further analysis may show that the selected features for this model should be refined, removed, or added. With a more predictive model, I could move on to test the training data with test data to see if model is over or under fitted.
