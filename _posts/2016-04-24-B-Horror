title: Profit margins of horror movies
published: false

Among movie genres, horror stands out for the relatively high number of low budget films that have become blockbusters. These low budget movies are often categorized as B Movies, which Wikipedia (get link) defines as low budget, non-arthouse films. For this analysis, I wanted to see what factors - in particular budget - impact the profit margin of horror movies. 

## Methodology

I broke up this analysis into data acquisition and analysis phases. I scraped data from [The Numbers](http://the-numbers.com/) and [Box Office Mojo](http://boxofficemojo.com/) using Beautiful Soup and Selenium. From these websites, I obtained my feature data: budget, domestic and international box office revenues, release date, and meta critic and user scores. I also deduced whether the movies were sequels or not. 

I performed a Lasso LARS analysis on the features to see which ones were of significance and which could be dropped. The Lasso LARS analysis showed that only budget, release year, and meta critic scores should be retained. This initially surprised me because I thought that meta user scores in particular would be a key feature. Looking back it makes sense that user scores - which correlate with critic scores - would be removed. This is because Lasso - when given two features that are highly correlated - will only select one and drop the other. I'm still not sure why sequels / remakes were not features of significance, and would need to look into this further if I do another analysis on this topic.

## Analysis

The histogram of profit margins includes overlays of movies. Duds like Idle Hands (which I thoroughly enjoyed by the way) had zero or negative margins, while blockbusters like Carrie and the Exorcist were at x and y, respectively. The first Friday the 13th had a margin of 100, meaning that its profit was 100 times more than its production buffet. I guess that's why they made a gazillion sequels. I generated a histogram of profit margins for the 165 movies I had complete data for. Predictably, the data followed an exponential distribution, meaning most movies had lower profit margins - with an average of 20 - with a few movies having outstanding profit margins. 

It's worth pointing out that the budget data I obtained from The Numbers likely doesn't include marketing and other costs, meaning the profit margin numbers reported in this analysis may be significantly over-estimated.

The chart below shows that Kiva users tend to be based in the US and male. Additionaly, almost 20% of the sample is involved in the tech industry or sciences.

I wanted to get an idea of the sample distribution by category, and so I created the chart below using [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/). We can see that the distribution of people from the US and Canada seems to be more concentrated at the lower end of loans per year axis than those in the rest of the world. In addition, high loans per year outliers are primarily male.

The statistical results are shown below. The R-squared value is low, and so the model's predictive power is nil. However, p values for the gender, region, invites per year, and lending reason features are low enough that we can reject the null hypothesis that these features have no impact on lending activity.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

This is a preliminary analysis, and more insights could be gleaned from the Kiva data. Even so, we can draw the following conclusions from this analysis:

- Microlending activity across microlenders seems to be exponentially distributed;
- While the model developed for this analysis is not predictive, it does explain a subset of the types of people that tends to make more microloans;
- Within the sample data, males and people living outside the US and Canada tend to be more active microlenders; and,
- More analysis is needed before we can say the same for people involved in tech and the sciences.

Further analysis may show that the selected features for this model should be refined, removed, or added. With a more predictive model, I could move on to test the training data with test data to see if model is over or under fitted.
