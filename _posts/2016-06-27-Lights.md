title: Revealing economic growth using night lights
published: true
---

After having worked in several developing countries, I've noticed that socio-economic data that is readily available in countries like the US - data we take for granted - is often unavailable in emerging markets. The means of collecting basic socio-economic data often simply aren't there. So then, how do we measure economic growth in places where statistics are imprecise or unavailable? 

## An Alternative to Traditional Statistical Methods

Let's look at an example of this issue. Annual GDP data for Syria and Afghanistan, two countries that have endured civil war, are unavailable for certain years, as shown in the figure below.

To fill data gaps such as these, [economists](http://economics.mit.edu/files/8945) and other researchers have used satellite night imagery as a proxy for economic activity. The image of satellite night lights from 2013 shown below suggests that there may be correlations between economic activity and night lights.

## Methodology

I obtained the satellite night imagery data from [NOAA](http://ngdc.noaa.gov/eog/dmsp/downloadV4composites.html) and GDP data from [World Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx). Using these inputs, I performed nearly 200 country-level regressions and estimated the GDPs of over 400 cities. To keep things simple, I used linear regression.

## Results

The results of the country-level regressions are shown below.

Rest of blog in progress. Stay tuned for the rest of the results!
