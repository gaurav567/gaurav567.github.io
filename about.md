I live in DC but I'm staying in New York until June 2016 to attend a data science bootcamp, [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com). I want to become a data scientist because I love solving large, complicated problems through the acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and presentation of data. My expertise is in emerging markets - particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa - in the telecom, mobile financial services, infrastructure, and energy industries.

### More Information

I grew up in Iowa and have lived in New Orleans, Massachusetts, Kenya, and DC. I love the Nebraska Cornhuskers, am currently listening to a lot of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, and am a news and politics junkie.
