Until June 2016, I'm based in New York where I'm enrolled at a data science bootcamp, [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com). I want to become a data because I love solving large, complicated problems through the acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and presentation data. So, just let me know if you gotta a problem and alotta data and don't know what to do about it ;)

### More Information

I grew up in Iowa and have lived in New Orleans, Massachusetts, Kenya, and DC. I love the Nebraska Cornhuskers, am currently listening to a lot of David Bowie and Iggy Pop, and am a news and politics junkie.
