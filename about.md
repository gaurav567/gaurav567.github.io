I live in DC and recently graduated from the [Metis Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com). I'm a data scientist because I love solving large, complicated problems through the acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and presentation of data. My expertise is in emerging markets - particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa - in the telecom, mobile financial services, infrastructure, and energy industries.

### More Information

I grew up in Iowa and have lived in New Orleans, Massachusetts, Kenya, and DC. I love the Nebraska Cornhuskers, tend to listen to lots of post-punk / new wave music, and am a news and politics junkie.
